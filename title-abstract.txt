Title:
Large-scale Multiple Testing with Empirical Null Distribution in Predicting Cardiovascular Disease

Abstract:
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of deaths globally. We use features and some health conditions of a person to determine the signals and the probability of whether he/she has cardiovascular disease. To achieve such a goal, we implemented logistic regression and large-scale multiple testing methods on a dataset with ample information. Empirical Null is applied to find outliers and filter the dataset, we successfully removed about 10000 outliers out of the 70000 observations by applying the FDR and FPR method to find the upper and lower bound. Finally, our product was a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether a person has Cardiovascular disease with an accuracy score of .7220 on the test set.
